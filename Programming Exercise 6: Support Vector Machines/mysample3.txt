Class 14 follow up
Dear students,

I hope you enjoyed this weekâ€™s class. The slides of each module may be updated from time to time, so whenever you see a notification you should download the most updated version. The video recording will be posted after each class. Please make sure you have access to these files and review the slides if you were not able to follow me during class.

HW 4 has been posted and it is due at 11:59pm on next Thu. Please fill out the class 13-14 survey. Question 2 is optional. Thanks.

I look forward to seeing you next class.

Have a nice weekend!
Tao
