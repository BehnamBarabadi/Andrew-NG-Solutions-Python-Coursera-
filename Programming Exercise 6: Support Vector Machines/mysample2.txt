You received this message because you have subscribed to Bowlmor emails (you may have signed up online or in person at one of our innovative entertainment venues). At Bowlmor, we believe that you should run the show when it comes to your email inbox; we value your privacy and realize that your email can only get so full. So, if you feel like taking a little break from our communiqués, that's okay-unlike your last relationship, you can get out of this one at any time by simply clicking the link below and unsubscribing from our mailing list. We'd obviously prefer you didn't (what we had was special, right?) plus, without emails from us, you won't be made aware of all the cool extras, special event invites, and other Bowlmor magic that would be sent to your inbox.

Ugh, I shouldn't be doing this, but-yes, please remove me from your email list. (I'm about to declare email bankruptcy, anyway.)

I still want to receive the latest & greatest from Bowlmor-but I need to update some information first.
